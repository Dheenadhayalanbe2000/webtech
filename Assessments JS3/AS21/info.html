      //1.let:
      //Advantages: Variables declared with let have block-level scope. They are only accessible within the block (curly braces) in which they are declared.

      //Reassign: Variables declared with let can be reassigned within the same block scope or even outside the loop.

      //Action in Loops: If you declare a variable with let inside a loop, the variable is reinitialized for each iteration of the loop.

      //2.const:

      //Advantages: Variables declared with const also have block-level scope like let.

      //Reassign: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. They are read-only constants.

      //Action in Loops: If you declare a variable with const inside a loop, the variable is reinitialized for each iteration of the loop, but you cannot assign a new value to it.

      //3.vcar:

      //Advantages: Variables declared with var have function-level scope or global scope if declared outside any function.

      //Reassignment: Variables declared with var can be reassigned within the same scope, including the global scope.

      //Behavior in Loops: If you declare a variable with var inside a loop, the variable is not reinitialized for each iteration of the loop. It retains its value from the last iteration or remains accessible outside the loop if declared globally.
