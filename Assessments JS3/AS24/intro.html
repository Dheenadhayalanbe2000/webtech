      //To evaluate the expression (3 + 5) * 2, we follow the order of operations, also known as the PEMDAS rule:

      //Parentheses: Perform operations inside parentheses first.
      //Exponents: evaluate any exponents (if there were any).
      //Multiplication and Division: Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right.
      //Addition and Subtraction: Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
      //Let's apply this to our expression:
      //(3 + 5) * 2

      //Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
      //(3 + 5) = 8

      //Multiplication: Perform multiplication of the result from step 1 by 2.
      //8 * 2 = 16

      //So, the result of the expression (3 + 5) * 2 is 16.

      //Now, let's write an expression to calculate the average of three numbers: num1, num2, and num3.

      //The average of three numbers is calculated by adding the numbers together and then dividing the sum by 3 (since we have three numbers). The expression can be written as:

      //Average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

      //For example, if we have num1 = 10, num2 = 20, and num3 = 30, the average would be:

      //Average = (10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20
